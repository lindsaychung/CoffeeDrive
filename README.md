# CoffeeDrive

This instruction is not a standalone building instruction, but an explanation of how to run ![Coffee Me](https://github.com/leonardean/CoffeeMe) and Coffee Driver on two different iOS simulator at the same time. To successfully go through the steps in this instruction, please make sure to complete the ![prerequisite](https://github.com/leonardean/CoffeeMe/blob/master/README.md).

# Steps

## Run Coffee Drive App
```
git clone https://github.com/leonardean/CoffeeDrive.git

Looking for JS files in
   /Users/leonardean/Desktop/CoffeeDrive


React packager ready.

Loading dependency graph, done.
```
Open another terminal window and go to the directory of `CoffeeDrive`
```
react-native run-ios
```
Now Coffee Drive App should be running on your default iOS simulator.

## Open another iOS simulator
```
cd /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Applications
open -n Simulator.app
```
When you execute `open -n Simulator.app`, a warning will appear with message "Unable to boot device in current state: Booted". This is because XCode is trying to boot another default simulator, which has already to booted. We just need to change to another model. Click `OK` to close the warning window and select `Hardware -> Device -> iOSX.X -> whatever model that is not currently open`.

Now you should have two iOS simulators running at the same time.

## Run Coffee Me app

Go to the directory of CoffeeMe
```
react-native start --port 8082
```
Another packager should now be running at port 8082
Open another terminal window and go to the directory of CoffeeMe
Open Xcode and change AppDelegate.m on the followngs to use port 8082
```
    jsCodeLocation = [NSURL URLWithString:@"http://localhost:8082/index.ios.bundle?platform=ios&dev=false"];
  //jsCodeLocation = [[RCTBundleURLProvider sharedSettings] jsBundleURLForBundleRoot:@"index.ios" fallbackResource:nil];
```
```
react-native run-ios --simulator "iPhone 6s"
```
Now CoffeeMe app should be running on the other iOS simulator.

## Tip
To speed up iOS simulator, press `Cmd` + 'D' to toggle develop menu, turn off remote debug, hot reload, live reload.
